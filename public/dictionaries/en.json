We can set up a VPN access with firewall rules for you, as well as a private DNS server. This way, your instance is only accessible to your authorized devices.

Your scanner is configured to automatically drop the documents in the Paperless Consumer folder. However, you can also add documents via smartphone, email, drag-n-drop, or API. Paperless regularly checks the Consumer for new content and then imports it into the system. After Paperless has successfully processed your document and created the OCR layer, you can add more details to your document. E.g., title, correspondent, date, document type, tags, or custom fields. Paperless has a matching algorithm and can set many details automatically over time. You can now find your document in seconds via search or filters. You can create users, workflows, and more.
