After Paperless has successfully processed your document and created the OCR layer, you can add more details to your document. E.g., title, correspondent, date, document type, tags, or custom fields. Paperless has a matching algorithm and can set many details automatically over time. You can now find your document in seconds via search or filters. You can create users, workflows, and more.
